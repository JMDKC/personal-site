description: "Being in lockdown made me miss travelling, and reminisce about intimidating entrances to commercial galleries in Paris. So I ranked them."

I’ve been lucky during this pandemic. I have kept my job, and can work from home, which is safely isolated and peaceful. No close friends or family have caught the virus, symptomatically at least. All of this can change, of course. I pray it doesn’t.

But, four months in, I can count a cancelled trip to Paris, originally planned for March, as a relatively major COVID-related disruption. 

My main hobby is visual art ([see side project here](http://artangled.com/)), so gallery-going is the main focus of my Paris trips. But of course galleries have been hit hard by the pandemic: in London, most commercial galleries have now reopened but have made a few changes. These days, visits tend to be by appointment, and opening hours are reduced. Which makes the barriers to entry (often physical as well as mental) for visiting that bit higher. 

In Paris, these barriers have always been high though. Most London galleries can be entered off the street or up a staircase; you only have to ring the bell to gain entry for a few of them. In Paris, bell-ringing is the norm, plus most of them are set back from the street, behind a courtyard. Generally there are two sets of doors (and buzzers) to negotiate, and two mini-conversations via the buzzer, in another language, with the gallerist indoors. Which all adds up to a lot of cringe moments, pride-swallowing, and plucking up of courage, to get inside.

I’m not complaining though. In a hard, impersonal and closed-off city, the difficulty of gaining entry, and those cringe moments, are compensated by finding what’s inside. Maybe the difficulty’s the point.

Here are 11 Parisian gallery entrances that have drifted into my mind today, as I wonder whether I’ll see them again in September, and how the world will have changed between now and then. For no reason at all, I’ve arranged them in ascending order of difficulty.

### Mazzoleni Art

Slap bang in the middle of the main bougie gallery district (the Marais), entrance to this one is pretty straightforward, given that the gallery has given you a line on the ground to follow. This is probably less for the visitor’s convenience though, and more to keep you away from the other buildings, with offices and flats, that the gallery shares. You don’t want to ring *their* bells.

### Vallois

On the Left Bank, the older and even more bougie gallery area in Paris. The outer door to this one is usually open, and to lower the barriers to entry still further, there’s a large flashing VALLOIS sign above the inner door! (Not pictured.) Definitely an entry-level entrance.

### Perrotin

Entrance to this one is fairly standard. You buzz in to the courtyard on the street, gallery is clearly marked on the opposite side of the courtyard. But Perrotin gains extra intimidation points for the courtyard itself being ultra-well kept and pretty. And a little bonus for hiding an entirely separate gallery building over the road that the visitor only realises is there if they wind their way through the first building and follow some discreet signs.

### Galerie Les Filles du Calvaire

Closer to the metro stop of the same name, in a marginally scuzzier area, this gallery gets points for its subtle fuck-yous: note the beautiful cobbles, set off by the sharp step at the threshold to the gallery itself. I have never not tripped on this step, but lucky for me I don’t have mobility problems or I’d have been turned away before I even hit the courtyard. Oh, and don’t come less than an hour before closing or they might have shut it already. This one would be higher ranked, but minor deduction for not having *another* buzzer on the main door to show the riffraff who’s really in charge here.

### Kamel Mennour

This gallery has two locations on the Left Bank. One directly faces the street (amateurs)! The other, pictured here, has an outer and inner door. Warning! The security guard will look put out if you try to open the inner door yourself: so act like you’re too posh to open your own doors instead, and everyone will feel more comfortable. I thought they only did that at Gagosian?

### Max Hetzler

The photo above is deceptive! The doorway in front of us is the one to the street - standard. But, behind the photographer, there are two further doors into the gallery. One push, one pull. One buzzer, one no buzzer. The last couple of times I’ve been here, they have been doing some building works, so the room between doors two and three has been dingy and unlit. This is evidently such a contorted way in that somebody at the gallery has broken, and sellotaped instructions on how to get in to the inner door: a remarkably rare concession to making it *easier* to get inside! Not that you can read them in the gloom though.

### Gaudel de Stampa

This one directly faces the Seine on the Left Bank, and is in a shared building facing onto a busy road. Which means you can barely hear the tannoy voice over the doorbell buzzer (*why* would they want a conversation though…?) You need to go through a basically unmarked corridor with several closed doors to find the gallery - add bonus points. But I’m taking one off for the extremely convenient toilet behind one of these doors.

### Galerie Thaddeus Ropac

This intensely show-off gallery is a bit lower-key in its Paris Marais location than it is in London (where I once bumped into Victoria Beckham, who has a shop next door, and looked at me like she’d quite like to have me killed). Note there are two doors, but zero doorbells *and* a wheelchair ramp. Don’t get too comfortable though, that door is going to SLAM behind you if you don’t cushion it, and you’ll get a Posh-level dirty look from behind the reception desk.

### Galerie Frank Elbaz

![a parisian gallery entrance](/media/gallery-entrances-9.jpg)

This one is adorable: it’s the grey-black building on the left. Buzzer to shared area from the street: no buzzer to the door of the gallery but the handle is almost invisible, plus no push/pull (*tirez*/*poussez*? Not sure.) sign. It’s not in the top 11 hardest-to-enter galleries or anything, I just enjoy this one a lot because it’s so pretty.

### NEW Galerie

![a parisian gallery entrance](/media/gallery-entrances-10.jpg)

High on the list despite being open to the street because of a) its aggressively truncated opening hours and b) its murderous staircase to the basement, which requires excellence both in the visitor’s sense of balance and their calf strength	. I think my ratio of visits during opening hours, according to Google Maps, and the gallery actually being open is about one in four.

### Marian Goodman

This door, this door! I’m calling it: Marian Goodman is the final boss of Parisian gallery entrances, because the potential embarrassment factor, combined with difficulty of entrance, is so high. Look closely at the left-hand wooden door in the picture above. There’s a small wooden door-within-the-door, that needs a twist of the handle and hefty push to get in, assuming the gallerist inside has bothered to buzz you. You’ll forget that you need to pull it by the time you come back outside. Extra bonus points for the entrance being on the very busy Rue du Temple, meaning you run the risk of gaining an amused audience if you need to buzz repeatedly or struggle with the door.

But then, once inside, you can pat yourself on the back. You’ve made it, the final boss is defeated. Go and see some art! And maybe reflect on the fact that, if this really has been enough of a challenge in your life that you might conceivably write a blog post about it in future then… you need some new challenges in your life.
