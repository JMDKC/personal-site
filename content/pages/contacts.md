###Future of Strategy


A global research project that took about a year, alongside my day-to-day PM tasks. The ‘Future of Strategy’ report was also based on a big user need: WARC’s hardcore fans, and paying users, tend to be planners at ad and media agencies. But within the marketing industry as a whole, the planning discipline is little-understood and often overlooked.

So I built a survey where we asked planners the same questions and aggregated the results. But I didn’t want to go too “quant” by sending an impersonal online form with some multiple choice questions – instead, I needed real, in-depth personal insights to go along with the data.

So the final Future of Strategy report was based on a global survey: phone, Skype and face-to-face interviews with 75 senior agency-side strategists, working around the world. It was a chance to shed some light on the current state of marketing strategy, and where the role might be going in future.

It’s since been a big success for the company. Not only is it the most-read report of the year on WARC, it has been presented on stage at some of the industry’s biggest events: from the Cannes Lions to Brand Week Istanbul.

That’s me in the back, somewhere

Researching, writing and promoting the report became more than just a side project to me. It was personally inspiring to see how many debates the report has sparked, and how widely it’s been shared.

###Artangled

Visual art is a major passion of mine. To practice Git and CSS, and give me a place to publish my (copious) notes from art shows, I build this deliberately simple website, using Github Pages and Jekyll. (Which I thoroughly recommend for mini-projects like this, given that it’s free hosting and you don’t have to bother with anything as complicated as a CMS.)

I’m having far too much fun with this project, which is very much a personal passion project rather than being anything for wide consumption. (Well, Artangled has all of 4 Twitter followers at time of writing…)

It’s well worth the £8 or so a year the domain costs from Namecheap. Though I do wish artangle.com had been available.

I wrote a bit more about my obsessive visual art hobby in this post. And I’m still updating the site itself a few times a month.

###WARC 100

This was the first digital product I built from the ground up, from initial idea to final release.

At it’s heart, it’s an annual ranking of the world’s best marketing campaigns and companies. Results are based on who won in strategy and effectiveness awards over the previous calendar year: which is handy, as WARC is the world’s biggest publisher of marketing strategy and effectiveness case study.

This meant that we could design and build a solid ranking algorithm that took into account a range of regional weightings, and allowed us to rank each awards win ‘by reputation’. (The full methodology’s here.)

The WARC 100 is therefore a lot more credible than some of the industry’s other rankings, which are based more on personal preference than objective data. The industry agrees, too, and each year’s results release gets global media coverage.

It’s become a real industry reference: we really knew we’d arrived when I found out from a former colleague who’d moved on to a WPP agency that the world’s biggest marketing company was using its WARC 100 performance as a KPI in its financial results deck.

###Agency Finder

This was my final project at General Assembly. I came up with the idea that, as my friends and peers at ad agencies were constantly changing jobs, there was a gap in the market for a specialist job finding service that complemented LinkedIn.

Other than this idea (I still think the gap’s there…), the project gave me the opportunity to explore PM concepts like building a roadmap, measuring performance and managing the product’s lifecycle.

###Novelty Magazine

I contributed features to this cultural affairs quarterly, writing on anything from the travials of being a cyclist in London to my morally dubious Deliveroo addiction.

My favourite piece (linked above) was an oral history of the legendary Anne Naysmith.
