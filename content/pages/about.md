![it me](/media/headshot.jpg)

I work in digital delivery at [Ascential](https://www.ascential.com/), a FTSE 250-listed information services company. More specifically, I run the agile ceremonies, manage the backlog and organise the technical documentation for several digital teams.

Previously, as a Product Manager at WARC I researched and wrote the [Future of Strategy report](/media/future-of-strategy.pdf), a deep dive into one of advertising’s most important but least-understood disciplines.

I also led development on the WARC 100, [now WARC Rankings](https://www.warc.com/rankings), one of the industry’s most widely-known ranking and benchmarking products.

I started on my - far from complete - journey to Agile via General Assembly, having previously worked as a financial journalist.

I hold an MA from the University of Bristol. I write about visual art each week on my other website, [Artangled](). I write about everything else I’m interested in here. Offline, I’m an avid bibliophile and traveller.
