I’m a product manager at WARC, the world’s largest advertising information service.

I researched and wrote the Future of Strategy report, a deep dive into one of advertising’s most important but least-understood disciplines.

I also led development on the WARC 100, one of the industry’s most widely-known ranking and benchmarking products.

I came to product management via General Assembly, having previously worked as a financial journalist.

I hold an MA from the University of Bristol. I write about visual art each week on my other website, Artangled. I write about everything else I’m interested in here. Offline, I’m an avid bibliophile and traveller.

This site was made with Gatsby.js, because I get a mild parasexual thrill from keeping all my writing locally in Markdown files, rather than trapped in somebody else’s CMS. It’s hosted on Netlify. You can look at the site’s code here.
